# SCMA 632: Statistical Analysis and Modelling

### Course Description
This will be a hands-on course using live/real datasets, focusing on automation using R & Python, employing contemporary methods of analysis with equal emphasis on interpreting the results and testing hypotheses. Topics covered will have an applied focus, including data handling, cleaning, anomaly detection, visualization, and data summarization & description. Further, the students will be exposed to analytical techniques such as regression analysis, logistic regression, categorical data analysis, and time series analysis. Determining the optimum model selection, including using machine learning algorithms to model data like random forest, market basket analysis, etc. The analysis of data will be conducted using business-oriented problems. Emphasis will be on interpretations of the results and making recommendations.

### Learning Outcomes
At the end of the course, students are expected to be proficient in:
- Accessing and cleaning data
- Describing its distribution and estimating its parameters
- Choosing and estimating the appropriate models to analyze data
- Fitting the best model for the given data & purpose
- Building a model using the training dataset and validating it using the validation dataset
- Automating repetitive calculations and interpreting the results

The course focuses on all three domains: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive statistics. Students will learn to analyze data using analytics tools and gather business insights. They will understand the process of data-driven decision-making to make more informed business decisions and test whether the analyses confirm the hypothesis. Students will apply ML techniques to solve business problems.
